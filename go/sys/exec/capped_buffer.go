// happened. It is the shared bound the agent wraps per-user command
// output buffers in, so a child process emitting unbounded output cannot
// exhaust the root agent's memory (WS6 #14).
//
// Write always reports the FULL len(p) as consumed and a nil error, even
// when bytes are dropped, so an io.Copy feeding it from a child's pipe
// never observes a short write (which it would treat as ErrShortWrite and
// abort, potentially wedging the child on a full pipe). Overflow is
// silently dropped; String/Bytes append the truncation marker so the
// loss is visible to a human reader.
