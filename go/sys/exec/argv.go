// SeparatePositionals builds an argv slice that places positionals
// after an explicit EndOfOptions ("--") separator, so a value that
// happens to be flag-shaped (a package name like "-e", a flatpak
// remote like "--from") can never be reparsed by the invoked program
// as an option. The "--" is ALWAYS inserted, even when there are no
// positionals — terminating the option list is harmless and keeps the
// invariant unconditional (callers never have to reason about the
// empty case).
//
// The result is a freshly-allocated slice; the caller's flags slice is
// never aliased or appended into, so a reused flag list stays
// pristine across calls.
